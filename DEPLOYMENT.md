# Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Recommended: Deploy on Replit

This application is optimized for **Replit Deployments** which fully supports the Express + Vite architecture.

### Steps to Deploy on Replit:

1. Click the **Deploy** button in your Replit workspace
2. Choose **Autoscale Deployment**
3. Add environment variables:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Set a strong password
   - `SESSION_SECRET` - Random 32+ character string
   - Optional Firebase variables (for persistent data)
4. Click **Deploy**

‚úÖ **Already Configured** - The deployment settings are ready to go!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deploying to Vercel (Not Recommended)

**Important**: This app uses a traditional Express server which doesn't work well with Vercel's serverless architecture. 

### Why Vercel Shows 404:

- Vercel expects serverless functions, not a persistent Express server
- The app needs to be restructured to work with Vercel's `/api` functions
- Session management and in-memory storage won't work reliably on Vercel

### Alternative Platforms:

If you can't use Replit Deployments, consider these alternatives:

1. **Railway.app** - Supports Express apps perfectly
2. **Render.com** - Free tier for Express apps
3. **Heroku** - Traditional platform for Node apps
4. **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Good for Express apps
